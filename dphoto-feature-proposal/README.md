## Submitted by: Fred Assaf (fredassaf.org)

## Overview

As a long-time dphoto customer with 715,000+ photos and 5.5TB of storage, I've been working with a developer to enhance my photo gallery experience. We've created several features that I believe would benefit all dphoto users.

I'm offering to serve as a **beta tester** for any of these features you'd like to implement.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Enhanced Social Sharing
**Problem:** Currently, sharing photos to social media requires multiple steps.

**Solution:** One-tap sharing buttons that:
- Share directly to Instagram (with pre-filled hashtags)
- Share to Facebook, Twitter, Messages, etc.
- Use the modern Web Share API (native on iOS/Android)
- Include the photo file directly, not just a link

**Benefit:** Increased engagement and word-of-mouth promotion for photographers.

### 2. "Save to Photos" Button
**Problem:** Downloading photos on mobile isn't intuitive.

**Solution:** A prominent "Save to Photos" button that:
- Downloads the full-resolution image with one tap
- Uses a meaningful filename (photo title + photographer name)
- Shows confirmation feedback ("Saved!")
- Works seamlessly on iOS, Android, and desktop

**Benefit:** Happy users who can easily save their purchased/free photos.

### 3. Photo Lightbox with Gestures
**Problem:** Viewing photos in detail could be more immersive.

**Solution:** A modern lightbox experience with:
- Smooth open/close animations
- Swipe gestures for next/previous (mobile)
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, ESC)
- Pinch-to-zoom support
- Photo counter and album info overlay

**Benefit:** More professional, app-like experience.

---

### 4. Custom CSS Support
**Problem:** Photographers want their galleries to match their brand.

**Solution:** Allow users to inject custom CSS to:
- Change colors, fonts, spacing
- Add custom backgrounds
- Style navigation elements
- Create unique gallery themes

**Benefit:** Differentiated galleries that reflect each photographer's brand.

## Demo & Code

I've included working code for all these features:

- `share-buttons.js` - Social sharing functionality
- `download-button.js` - Save to Photos functionality  
- `lightbox.js` - Enhanced photo viewer
- `styles.css` - Styling for all components
- `demo.html` - Interactive demo page

All code is well-documented and ready for integration.
